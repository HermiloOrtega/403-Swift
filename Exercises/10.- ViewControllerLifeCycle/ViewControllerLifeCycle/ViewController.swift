import UIKit

// Summary
// 1. Instantiated (from storyboard or code) - init
// 2. awakeFromNib (only if instantiated from a storyboard)
// 3. segue preparation happens (storyboard)
// 4. outlets get set (storyboard)
// 5. viewDidLoad
// 6. These pairs will be called each time your Controller's view goes on/off screen
//    - viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear
//    - viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear
// 7. These "geometry changed" methods might be called at "any time" after viewDidLoad
//    - viewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews
// 8. At any time, if memory gets low, you might get...
//    - didReceiveMemoryWarning
// 9. When your device rotates, viewWillTransition gets called

    // good time to update my view using your model, because outlets are all set

    // This is also a good place to start something expensive (e.g. network fetch) going.
    // Why kick off expensive things here instead of in viewDidLoad?
    // Because we know that we're on screen so it won't be a waste.
    // By "expensive" usually mean "time consuming" but could also mean battery or storage.
